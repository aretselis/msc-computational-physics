Questions from the exam to enter the MSc in Computational Physics at the Physics Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for the academic year 2020-2021.

### Question 1

Write a program in which the user has to input three natural numbers. These numbers are to be added but if any number is in the range [90,100] it is to be excluded from the sum unless it is number 91 or 97. The sum shall be returned to the user.
