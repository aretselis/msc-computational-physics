# Exam 2021

This is the February 2021 exam for the Data Analysis and Processing Using MATLAB (YΦΥ104) class. Problem statements can be found in `ExamFeb2021_Problem_Statements.pdf`.

My own solutions as-written during the exam are attached for reference. Note that `Retselis_Thema2.m` requires `DataEx2No1.dat` inside the same directory in order to run.
