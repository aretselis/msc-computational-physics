# Data Analysis and Processing Using MATLAB (YΦΥ104)

## Directory Structure

In this directory readers can find the following folders:

1. **Exercises Source Code,** the folder containing my own solutions developed for the optional weekly exercises.
2. **Project 2021,** the folder containing the code I developed for the class's project.
3. **Exam 2021,** the folder containing the code I authored during the 2h exam for the class.

Note that all of the above were completed as part of my normal workload during the winter semester of the academic year 2020/2021.

## Course overview

Data Analysis and Processing Using Matlab (7.5 ECTS credits) is one of the four core classes in the MSc Computational Physics. It consists of weekly 3h lectures which are accompanied with optional exercises for students to complete. The class is graded based on a project that the students have to develop (50% of the final grade) and a written 2h exam (50% of the final grade). If students choose to complete and submit the optional exercises every week, they are assigned only a portion of the project.

## Course Syllabus 

1. **Introduction:** definitions, data, examples. 
2. **Probability and random variables:** fundamentals on probability, distributions, parameters of distributions, basic distributions. 
3. **Elements of statistics:** parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. 
4. **Uncertainty and measurement error:** systematic and random errors, error propagation. 
5. **Correlation and regression:** correlation, simple and multiple regression, linear and nonlinear regression. 
6. **Time series:** basic characteristics of time series, correlation in time series.
