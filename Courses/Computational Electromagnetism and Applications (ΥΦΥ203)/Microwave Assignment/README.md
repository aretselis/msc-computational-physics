# Microwave Oven Assignment (Project 2021)

## General Information 

This is the directory containing the project assignment for the Computational Electromagnetism and Applications class for the academic year 2020-2021. The project is graded and contributes 40% of the final grade. 

## Project Description

For this assignment, one has to simulate the heating of a plate containing food inside a microwave oven using the Finite Differences Time Domain (FDTD) method. The plate is disc shaped and contains a disc-shaped piece of meat and two potatoes shaped like spheres, forming the so called "Mickey's Face". Four simulations are to be performed, each one rotating the plate by 90 degrees inside the microwave oven. For each simulation, the SAR is to be calculated for the food items using the corresponding voxels. Finally, the uniformity or non-uniformity of the heating inside the microwave oven is to be examined inside the microwave oven.

### Personal Solution

I worked on this assignment using the SEMCAD software suite. This directory contains two files, namely:

1. `retselis_microwave_project.pdf`, which contains the final report containing information on the model developed, results and discussion on the results.
2. `retselis_SEMCAD_model.zip`, which contains the model developed in SEMCAD and the raw results obtained in `.xlsx` format.
