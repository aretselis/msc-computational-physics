# Computational Mathematics (YΦΥ101)

## Directory Structure

In this directory readers can find the following folders:

1. **Code,** the directory containing some demo exercises developed as part of optional course work.
2. **Problem Sets,** the directory containing the three problem sets which are part of the course.

Note that all of the above were completed as part of my normal workload during the winter semester of the academic year 2020/2021.

## Course overview

Computational Mathematics (7.5 ECTS credits) is one of the four core classes in the MSc Computational Physics. It consists of weekly 3h lectures. The class is graded based on three problem sets which students must submit (30% of the grade) and a written 2h exam (70% of the final grade).

## Course Syllabus 

The class is based on numerical methods. Topics include:

1. **Introduction:** significant figurers, approximation, trunctuation and round-off errors
2. **Roots of equations:** Bracketing methods, open methods
3. **Linear systems:** Gauss method, Gauss-Jordan, LU, Jacobi and others
4. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:** power methods etc.
5. **Data fitting:** Polynomial fit, Lagrange, Newton and Newton-Gregory polynomials
6. **Numerical Differentiation and Integration:** Formulas, O-notation, integration methods and error analysis
7. **Ordinary Differential Equations:** Euler, Runge-Kutta, higher order Runge-Kutta other methods, error analysis 
8. **Partial Differential Equations:** Methods for working with elliptic, parabolic and hyberbolic equations.
