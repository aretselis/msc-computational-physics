# Problem Sets

## Overview 

As part of the Computational Mathematics class, students have to complete three problem sets in their preferred programming language. This directory contains the three problem sets for the academic year 2020-2021 and my own solutions, which are developed in Python.

Solutions have been authored in Jupyter notebooks and submitted as .pdf files for grading. Problem statements can be found inside the files.

1. For the **first problem set**, see `retselis_set1.ipynb` or `retselis_set1.pdf`.
2. For the **second problem set**, see `retselis_set2.ipynb` or `retselis_set2.pdf`.
3. For the **third problem set**, see `retselis_set3.ipynb` or `retselis_set3.pdf`.
