# Computational Astrodynamics (ΥΦΥ204)

## Directory Structure

In this directory readers can find the following folders:

1. **Class Source Code**, which includes problems solved in class throughout the semester.
2. **Problem Sets**, which includes descriptions and solutions to the weekly problem sets given by the instructors of the course. This directory also includes the final project for the class about the Didimos-Dimorphos system.

Note that all of the above were completed as part of my normal workload during the spring semester of the academic year 2020/2021.

## Course overview

Computational Astrodynamics (7.5 ECTS credits) is one of the compulsory elective courses students can choose in the MSc Computational Physics. It consists of weekly 3h lectures which are accompanied with obligatory exercises for students to complete every week. The class is graded based on the weekly problem sets (30% of the final grade), the final project (30% of the final grade) and the final 2h exam (40% of the final grade).

## Course Syllabus

1. **Introduction:** N-body problem, orbital elements and frames of reference.
2. **Two-body problem:** Kepler's laws, Elliptic motion
3. **Perturbation theory:** Solar radiation pressure, aerodynamic drag
5. **Orbital transfers**: Hohmann transfers, Bi-elliptic transfers, non-tangential maneuver, out of plane maneuver, launches from earth to parking orbits.
6. **Pendulum:** Pendulum motion, Poincare sections, Perturbed motion, FLI chaotic index.
7. **Spin-orbit coupling:** Theory, stable/unstable solutions.
8. **Hamiltonian systems:** Definitions, Integrals, Phase space, Poincare sections,Perturbed systems with 2 DoF, zero velocity curves, stability, polynomial systems.
9. **Restricted three body problem:** Fixed/Rotating reference frames, normalization of units, Jacobi integrals, Lagrange points, Motion about Lagrange points.
