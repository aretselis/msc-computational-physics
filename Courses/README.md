# Courses

The Master of Science in Computational Physics (90 ECTS) is split into 3 main course categories, namely:

1. **Core Courses**, which are common and obligatory for all students.
2. **Compulsory Elective Courses**, from which students must select a minimum of 2 courses. 
3. **Elective Courses**, from which students must select a minimum of 2 courses.
